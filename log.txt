* Should you use a 1K or 4K?  The 4K is only available from Mouser, but the 1K is at Digikey or Mouser
  It turns out Mouser has them on order, but not available, so they must be subject to shortages, so the 1K is a safer bet

* should you multiplex the address and data buses onboard?  So you'd have 4 x 16-bit bidirectional transceivers, 2 for
  each bus, and the low voltage side would be wired together and go to one set of 32 FPGA I/Os, and the EN and DIR pins
  for each bus would be wired to the FPGA so it can enable one or the other but not both?
* no I think if you want to do that, you need a latch for the address bus or else it can't actually make a transaction
  on the bus to program the flash chips onboard computie
* but for reading, you'd still need the address pins to be an input, meaning you'd need an extra set of transceivers...
* so it sounds like, either use 64 pins (out of 96 I/O pins), or 6 x 16bit chips, or just don't use it to program flash,
  or act as a bus sender, but instead just be a device and sniffer/analyzer
* just do a passive device for now, not a bus sender, so only 4 multiplexing chips
