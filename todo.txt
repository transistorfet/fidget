FIDGET HARDWARE:

  * what if the next iteration you add an arm microcontroller, either a SAMD or STM32

  * figure out what you need to do about the SPI disconnect to program the chip
  * should I wire up the WP and HOLD signals of the flash to FPGA pins?

  * what kind of ports, and easy extensions, should the board have?
    - it already have the primary USB interface
    - 6 pin Serial-to-USB interface (4 I/O)
    - buttons and LEDs for general use
    - headers that can be used for SPI, I2C, and others, for interfacing with offboard devices (2 I/O for I2C, 4 I/O for SPI)
    - type A USB for a USB Host? (an additional 2-3 I/O)
    - perhaps in a later revision, I can add Ethernet and SVGA/HDMI (although I think the chip isn't big enough for video gen)
    - later, could impl an fm synth in fpga with dac audio bitstream as output


  * what is alternate language for bus master? sender/receiver, requester(initiator)/responder, controller/peripheral(device),
