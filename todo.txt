FIDGET HARDWARE:

  * the DSACK and BERR signals can't really be satisfactorily handled by the transceivers.  They should probably be using an
    open collector, which might actually be ok to use a 3.3V chip with the 5V bus because it should only ever be connecting
    ground to the pin, and be high impedence otherwise... either way you should have a separate chip for that, and you could
    get rid of the extra HC245 transceiver
  * instead of using the invertor gate for the control signals, which didn't work, you could use it for the address and data
    output enables so that only one is ever turned on at the same time, since you had issues with the chips burning up due to
    a misconfiguration

  * what if the next iteration you add an arm microcontroller, either a SAMD or STM32

  * figure out what you need to do about the SPI disconnect to program the chip
  * should I wire up the WP and HOLD signals of the flash to FPGA pins?

  * what kind of ports, and easy extensions, should the board have?
    - it already have the primary USB interface
    - 6 pin Serial-to-USB interface (4 I/O)
    - buttons and LEDs for general use
    - headers that can be used for SPI, I2C, and others, for interfacing with offboard devices (2 I/O for I2C, 4 I/O for SPI)
    - type A USB for a USB Host? (an additional 2-3 I/O)
    - perhaps in a later revision, I can add Ethernet and SVGA/HDMI (although I think the chip isn't big enough for video gen)
    - later, could impl an fm synth in fpga with dac audio bitstream as output
