Revision 1 Errata and Notes
===========================

- the silkscreen for the VBUS voltage jumper was forgotten.  It should label each position as 5V
  or 3.3V

- the horizontal back to back capacitors in the power supplies and elsewhere are a little hard to
  solder.  Not really hard, just a little harder, especially the 1uF caps which are quite tall

- there's a surprising amount of inrush current, such that I have to set the current limit to 350mA
  to get it to start without the FPGA.  I take it this is caused by the bypass capacitors
  chips on

- the bus power jumper is awfully close to the ribbon cable connector.  It should be fine, but I'd
  prefer it being further away, if I designed this again

- the 16 MHz oscillator's footprint should be a lot bigger because it was very difficult to hand
  solder.  The 3.6864 MHz one was much easier because it turned out the chips I got weren't much
  bigger than the 16 MHz ones, but the footprint was for a much bigger chip, and also had enough
  overlap, so that the 4 corners had lots of solder pad to heat up

- it would have helped to have silkscreen labels for the SPI Flash connector

- it would have been more helpful to have the CRESET either wired to a pin on the SPI Flash
  connector or at least just beside the button, so it could be forcefully held low for programming
  the SPI flash.  As it is, the reset button must be held for the whole time it's programming

- the send/receive signal means that the DSACK and BERR signals must always be outputs, which
  interferes with other devices sharing the bus, making it hard to act as a generic peripheral.
  The transceiver should just have a separate I/O to control the direction of each half

- USART flow control signals should be named appropriately on the FPGA pins, like the TX and RX
  pins which are named correctly on the FPGA input but the silkscreen matches what the
  USB-to-Serial convertors label the pins as.  I've changed the pin mapping to match what they
  should be.  DTR should be renamed CTS, and CTS should be renamed RTS, so they always match the
  local endpoint, and they're cross-wired like the RX/TX pins for the other end.
