 
Revision 1 Errata and Notes
===========================

- the silkscreen for the VBUS voltage jumper was forgotten.  It should label each position as 5V
  or 3.3V

- the horizontal back to back capacitors in the power supplies and elsewhere are a little hard to
  solder.  Not really hard, just a little harder, especially the 1uF caps which are quite tall

- there's a surprising amount of inrush current, such that I have to set the current limit to 350mA
  to get it to start without the FPGA.  I take it this is caused by the bypass capacitors
  chips on

- the bus power jumper is awfully close to the ribbon cable connector.  It should be fine, but I'd
  prefer it being further away, if I designed this again
