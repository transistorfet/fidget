Fidget - The FPGA Widget
========================

###### *Started January 5, 2023*

This project is an experiment in making a board using a Lattice iCE40 FPGA in a surface mount
package (LQFP-100 or LQFP-144).  It will have bus connectors to allow it to be hooked up to
one of the [computie](https://jabberwocky.ca/projects/computie/) single board computers, to be
used as either a debug monitor to replace the arduino, or as generic expansion device, but also
with an eye towards being repurposed, for example as a generic logic analyzer.  It will need to
have bus transceivers to level convert between 5V inputs and the 3.3V I/O pins of the FPGA.
